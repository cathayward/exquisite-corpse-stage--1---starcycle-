## Briefs for each stage

### 🔴 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 🟡 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 🟢 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 🔵 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 🟣 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

**stage one:**

Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

i wanted to do a cyclic representation of the lifecycle of a star from conception (nebula) to destruction (supernova)

**the cycle:**
1. a nebula - which is a cloud of gases and dust that is being condensed by gravity
2. main sequence star - otherwise known as supermassive  and has a stable core - it then expands and gets hotter - 90% of its life time
3. a red supergiant is then formed which has an unstable core and when that core implodes, collapses and bursts into a
4. supernova - freeing all elements created in its lifetime
5. what’s left of the star is a stellar black hole that has an intense gravitational pull

**notes**
- the idea is that i will code a sequence of images to change in accordance to the life cycle of a star perhaps over a background of everchanging stars in a galaxy
- i ran into an issue when trying to make the sequence loop without deleting the background and the stars, i was also trying to figure out a way to delay the start of the star sequence without slowing down the gap currently between each star forming.
- the idea is that the little stars will show up, and then the 5 larger images will show up in succession along the line, and then they will disappear and loop again.
